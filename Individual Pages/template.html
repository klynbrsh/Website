        <p>This website redesign focused mainly on changing an old, outdated website to a clean, minimalistic design. It goes through the UX process and focuses on user needs as well as stakeholder needs. The main feature was the simplified navigation and the design update. Using an abbreviated version of the UX process, UI design, and coding process, I came up with a unique, simplified design.</p>
