          <h1>Overview</h1>
      <p>
        The main point of this project was to learn how to design around the grid system, as well as taking an article heavy site and making it easier to use. Essentially the professors wanted us to explore new ideas while still learning how to work around constraints such as the grid. In the time of one week, my team and I did a shortened version of the process in order to stick to our deadlines. Through competitive analyis and a little user interviews, we came up with our simplified and unique design. The main characteristics included a way to personalize filters of which article sections showed up on the feed. As well as a static page that refreshed the articles as you got saved or removed them. Another important aspect was the run-down feature, which would show a bulleted list of the sections biggest news.</p>

          <h1>Discover</h1>
          <p> Because of the limited time frame, my group decided to focus on competitive analysis and a few basic interviews to figure out what was important to users. All the team members came to this project with different views on news sites, so that's where we started the why or why not we were using them and what characteristics or features would help us. After that we decided on what target audience we wanted to focus on and the best ways to incorporate that into the new designs.</p>
        <!-- <div><h4>Interviews</h4></div> -->

  <hr id="Define">
  
      <article>
          <h1>Define</h1>
          <p>The team decided to simplify the pain points for the users we were targeting, to do that we pulled out the ones we felt we could fix.</p>
          <br><br>
          <div><h4>Problem Areas</h4>
            <br>
          <h5><strong>
        People didn't have time to read all the articles to get the most important news.</strong>
          </h5>
          <p>
            A lot of the users reading/using news articles have important jobs and things to do, because of that they don't always have the time to read all the articles. They also needed to stay relevant in order to connect with others over important issues.  
        </p>
          <br>
          <h5><strong>
        Incorporating new, younger users needed a new feature and less clutter.</strong>
          </h5>
          <p>
          A lot of news articles weren't reaching the younger generations. We learned a lot of this was becuase the sites themselves were cluttered and seemed endless. A lot of younger users also didn't want to have to read through a lot of stuff and didn't have a huge reason to try to stay caught up on the news.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h5><strong>
          People wanted to filter out the news they didn't consider important. </strong>
              </h5>
              <p>
              A lot of the users had certain sections they didn't ever read or utilize. In order to declutter the space, we decided to find a way to eliminate these sections so that the site could seem less claustrophobic.
              </p><br>
          </div>
          <div class="doubleimg"><h4>Character Profiles</h4> <br>
          <p> Because this time line was so short, we eliminated creating a specific profile and stuck to designing not only for the users currently using the site, but also the younger generation of millenials. To determine the average demographics of the users we did a lot of research through the site itself as well as google analytics.</p>

      <article>
          <h1>Develop</h1>
          <p> Having defined the problem, we moved into developing the solution. </p><br>
          <p>The Process:</p>

          <img class="user_img" src="img/WSJ/mobile sketch.jpg" alt="" style="width: 450px;">

          <img class="user_img" src="img/WSJ/desktop sketch.jpg" alt="" style="width: 850px;">
        </article>
          <div><h4>A&B Testing</h4>
            <p>For the A&B testing we used the paper wireframes we developed as well as the 2 color schemes we created. Users were very candid about their concerns: long flows with multiple screens made for a really boring process, the Rent component was the most important and gave users a reminder as to why they were filling out the forms, adding roommates should be done after the onboarding process. The color schemes went over somewhat well, with about a 50-50 split. So, we also looked for ways to improve this. </p>

           <p>"I love the run-down feature. I never have time to find/read the important stuff."</p>
         </div>
         <div class="usertest" style="width:250px;">
            <p>"I like the idea of swipeing to get rid of the articles I don't want to read. But I would need to see it just ot be sure."</p>
          </div>
          <div class="usertest" style="width:250px;">
            <p>"I love this design a lot; less cluttered and much better looking than the old one."</p>

          </div>
          <br><br><br>
          <div><h4> High-Res Wireframes</h4>
            <p>We settled on a combination of the color schemes for two reasons. First, both lighter colors were aesthetically pleasing and had the right effects psychologically that we wanted to convey. Second, they complement and contrasted very well with each other and still gave the app a very light, open, and fun feeling. We wanted the colors to blend in with the environment, not detract from it. </p>
