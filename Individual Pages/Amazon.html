          <h1>Overview</h1>
      <p>
          Over the course of three weeks my group and I interviewed about 25 individuals. Our research revealed a few pain points that a new feature might help eliminate. We redesigned the platform so that users could exercise these features (individualizing their recommendations) to help Amazon recommend more relatable products in the hopes it would increase sales. Although individualizing was the main goal, in our Discovery phase we worked on the idea of minimizing the amount of space it took to display information and decided to follow both directions.</p>

          <h1>Discover</h1>
          <p> While the brief was fairly open-ended, my team and I were interested in the overall problems faced in using Amazon Prime and their Desktop site. All of us experienced friction trying to find the cheapest, highest quality product that best fit what we wanted. Our first round of interviews set out to discover how other people interact with Amazon in their daily lives.</p>

                    <p>More than 70% of our interviewees answered that they start on Amazon with a product already in mind and the search bar is their first click. They also indicated that a lot of the time they use reviews as their only means of quality checking before purchasing an item. In the next set of interviews we honed in on this behavior. We also looked into the other aspects of Amazon we were still debating on including (gift-recommendations and deal-notifications).</p>

                <p>
                    Attempts to research how to implement a gift-recommendation feature or a deal-notification system led to the discovery that Amazon already has these features incorporated. After some testing to determine how many people knew about these functions, we determined that Amazon had to many features hidden in places most users didn’t know to look.

        <p>In order to keep to the time frame, we broke down the discovery results into several areas we felt that with a little more research could become full projects. We broke the project down into four categories of interest. We then did more interviewing and surveying around these categories: </p>

        <li>
          <p>Streamlining through overcrowding pages</p>

          <h1>Define</h1>
          <p> A decent way into the project timeline, my team and I were concerned. We discovered multiple pain points for users but still had no real clear sense of hierarchy between them and no idea on which point to focus on and how to go about fixing it.</p>
          <br><br>
          <div><h4>Problem Areas</h4>
            <br>
          <h5><strong>
        Minimalism: simplifying and changing heirarchy</strong>
          </h5>
          <p>
            Amazon has a lot going for it. Millions of items, that ship to millions of people, across multiple platforms. They have hundreds of features and several options when it comes to searching for that perfect item and filtering through those results. The need for simplification was obvious, but what information did users want to see and what was the best way to convey it.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h5><strong>
        Customization of Home Page: a personal approach</strong>
          </h5>
          <p>
          People love personalized things. Why should product recommendations be any different? Not only would personalizing recommendations benefit the user, it would also benefit Amazon. By increasing interest in related products, Amazon might experience more sales and higher customer interaction.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h5><strong>
        Price/Deal Notifications: is cheaper always better</strong>
          </h5>
          <p>
            It was common for our interviewees to use multiple e-commerce sites to find the best deals. But it was easy to imagine scenarios in which a user might subscribe to just one because of the great deals and prices Amazon offers. The need for a better tool to notify users of the best deals and prices across all of their interests and products appeared more pronounced.
          </p>
          <br><br>
          </div>
          <div class="doubleimg"><h4>User Personas</h4> <br>
          <p> To match our interviews/survey results, we created two users personas before continuing with Chris Kroese who we believed more accurately fit the user we were trying to target.</p>
            <img src="img/Amazon_Persona_Female.png" style="width: 450px;"> <img src="img/Amazon_Persona_Male.png"style="width: 450px;">

            <br>
            <p>
              Based off of our research and our target user, we came up with the following problem statement:
            </p>
            <img src="img/ProblemstatementAmazon.png" style="width: 600px">
          </div>
          <br><br>
          <div><h4>Feature Benefit Matrix</h4>
            <br>
            <p>
              Once we had a clear goal of our problem, we created the feature benefit matrix to determine the heirarchy of which features should be included in terms of time limit as well as how beneficial they are to the users and the company.

          <p> Having defined our problem, we moved into developing the solution. Our Process:</p>
          <br>
          <div><h4>Journey Map</h4>
            <p>We extracted steps from a user journey in which our persona would need a tool to help him decide the best product to purchase and used those steps to build a user flow. Then we translated each step in this flow into sketches which we incorporated into our storyboard.</p>

          </div>
          <div><h4>Storyboard</h4>
            <p>Based off of the User Journey steps we created the following storyboard:</p>

          <p>We went through three iterations and two user testing sessions before reaching our final designs. Below are some components and their evolution, with notes concerning feedback from our testing sessions. </p>

          <div><h4>A&B Testing</h4>
            <p>For the A&B testing we used the paper wireframes we had created and made a Invision prototype for users to test. They were very candid about their concerns: a distaste for the reviews and product description layout and a general dislike of the onboarding process led to a complete redesign of both. Several users also made it clear that the icons were a little hard to understand which led to a change of design for those as well.</p>

         <div class="usertest" style="width:250px;">
            <p>"I actually like the different icons (wishlist, and add to cart icons). It's pretty slick looking!"</p>

          <div class="usertest" style="width:250px;">

          <div><h4> High-Res Wireframes</h4>
            <p>We settled on the same color scheme for two reasons. First, Amazon’s brand is already well established with these colors. Second, they complement and contrast very well with other colors. We wanted the colors to blend in with the environment, not detract from it. </p>

          <h1>Done?</h1>
          <p> There is no one solution to a problem, just as there is never just one problem. People and sites continue to evolve and change. The following is what I would do if I were to continue to work on this project:</p>
          <br>
          <div><h5><strong>Moving Forward with this project</strong></h5>
            <p>because of our limited time frame, our group did not have as much time to incorporate the user testing as we had hoped for. There is also always more room for user testing, to ensure this product is the best design. I also believe there is more to unifying desktop with the mobile and tablet version that we could have done.</p>
          </div>
          <br>
          <div><h5><strong>Moving Forward as an team</strong></h5>
            <p> I think throughout this process our team realized how much more we needed to communicate about our ideas, as well as follow through with what we say we are going to do. There is also a limit to how much research you can do before having to move on and work on the actual design, especially with such a short deadline. </p>
          </div>
          <br>
          <div><h5><strong>Moving Forward as an individual</strong></h5>
            <p> Throughout this process I have come to realize that I enjoy a leadership role, and need to figure out how to control that in groups with no set leader. I also realized that I tend to do things that aren't mine to do if someone didnt't do them right, so I need to work on focusing on my own tasks and helping them do their stuff the right way.</p>
