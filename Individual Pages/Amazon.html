          <h1>Overview</h1>
          <p> A redesign of the Amazon Website to make it more intuitive for users. The four member team also worked to unify the design across all devices.</p>
      <br>
      <p>
          Over the course of three weeks my group and I interviewed about 25 individuals. Our research revealed a few pain points that a new feature might help eliminate. We redesigned the platform so that users could exercise these features (individualizing their recommendations) to help Amazon recommend more relatable products in the hopes it would increase sales. Although individualizing was the main goal, in our Discovery phase we worked on the idea of minimizing the amount of space it took to display information and decided to follow both directions.</p>

          <h1>Discover</h1>
          <p> While the brief was fairly open-ended, my team and I were interested in the overall problems faced in using Amazon Prime and their Desktop site. All of us experienced friction trying to find the cheapest, highest quality product that best fit what we wanted. Our first round of interviews set out to discover how other people interact with Amazon in their daily lives.</p>

                    <p>More than 70% of our interviewees answered that they start on Amazon with a product already in mind and the search bar is their first click. They also indicated that a lot of the time they use reviews as their only means of quality checking before purchasing an item. In the next set of interviews we honed in on this behavior. We also looked into the other aspects of Amazon we were still debating on including (gift-recommendations and deal-notifications).</p>

                    Attempts to research how to implement a gift-recommendation feature or a deal-notification system led to the discovery that Amazon already has these features incorporated. After some testing to determine how many people knew about these functions, we determined that Amazon had to many features hidden in places most users didn’t know to look.

          <p>Streamlining through overcrowding pages</p>

      <article id="Define">
          <h1>Define</h1>
          <p> A decent way into the project timeline, my team and I were concerned. We discovered multiple pain points for users but still had no real clear sense of hierarchy between them and no idea on which point to focus on and how to go about fixing it.</p>
          <br><br>
          <div><h4>Problem Areas</h4>
            <br>
          <h5>
            Minimalism: simplifying and changing heirarchy
          </h5>
          <p>
            Amazon has a lot going for it. Millions of items, that ship to millions of people, across multiple platforms. They have hundreds of features and several options when it comes to searching for that perfect item and filtering through those results. The need for simplification was obvious, but what information did users want to see and what was the best way to convey it.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h5>
            Customization of Home Page: a personal approach
          </h5>
          <p>
          People love personalized things. Why should product recommendations be any different? Not only would personalizing recommendations benefit the user, it would also benefit Amazon. By increasing interest in related products, Amazon might experience more sales and higher customer interaction.
          </p>
          <h5>
            Price/Deal Notifications: Is cheaper always better
          </h5>
          <p>
            It was common for our interviewees to use multiple e-commerce sites to find the best deals. But it was easy to imagine scenarios in which a user might subscribe to just one because of the great deals and prices Amazon offers. The need for a better tool to notify users of the best deals and prices across all of their interests and products appeared more pronounced.
          </p>
          <br><br>
          </div>
          <div class="doubleimg"><h4>User Personas</h4> <br>
          <p> To match our interviews/survey results, we created two users personas before continuing with the one we believed more accurately fit the user we were trying to target.</p>
            <img src="img/Amazon_Persona_Female.png"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<img src="img/Amazon_Persona_Male.png">
          </div>
          <br><br>
          <div>
            <br>
            <p>
              Based off of our research and our target user, we came up with the following problem statement:
            </p>
            <img src="img/ProblemstatementAmazon.png" style="width: 600px">
          </div>
          <br><br>
          <div><h4>Feature Benefit Matrix</h4>
            <br>
            <p>
              Once we had a clear goal of our problem, we created the feature benefit matrix to determine the heirarchy of which features should be included in terms of time limit as well as how beneficial they are to the users and the company.

          <br><br><br>
          <div><h4>Journey Map</h4>
            <p>We extracted steps from a user journey in which our persona would need a tool to help him decide the best product to purchase and used those steps to build a user flow. Then we translated each step in this flow into sketches which we incorporated into our storyboard.</p>

          <div><h4>Storyboard</h4>
            <p>Based off of the User Journey steps we created the following storyboard:</p>
