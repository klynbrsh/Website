        <h1>COAC</h1>
        <p>This website redesign focused mainly on changing an old, outdated website to a clean, minimalistic design. It goes through the UX process and focuses on user needs as well as stakeholder needs. The main feature was the simplified navigation and the design update. Using an abbreviated version of the UX process, UI design, and coding process, I came up with a unique, simplified design.</p>

<div class="research" id="Research">
    <h5>User Research</h5>
    <h6 id="User">Defining the user</h6>
    <p>I learned through local contacts that the COAC Austin website was in need of a redesign. I suggested that stakeholders reach out to the consulting firm I work for,  BrushStrokes Consulting, so I could work on the design. The research aspect of this site was a little easier because I had many connections within the field. I determined the average user was a 40-year-old female with at least one adopted child. Most of these children had severe mental and emotional issues and often the mother was a stay-at-home mom. The parents were stressed out and in need of support from people in similar situations.</p>
    <h6 id="Flow">Stakeholder Interviews</h6>
    <p>The stakeholders were the ones who mentioned needing a website redesign, so I began with them to determine what the site’s current problems were. The stakeholders presented their opinions on the site and it was very helpful. A lack of up-to-date information and a very outdated design was their main concern.</p>

    <h6 id="Paper">Ethnographic Research</h6>
    <p>For this research, I followed selected users through a few hours of their day. Most of my research was on weekends so the kids were home all day. It quickly became obvious that these moms were very stressed out and were being pulled in a million different directions. When they had time to go online it was usually only for a few minutes and that was frequently interrupted multiple times. Because of this, I knew that condensing the site’s information and making it easy to leave and return to needed to be the primary focus.  Most of participants also mentioned that the group was helpful to them because they felt they were getting the support they needed. So I knew support was another important thing to convey through the site.</p>
    <h6 id="Low">Sketches</h6>
    <p>After all my research I moved into doing sketches. My original idea was to focus on the redesign of each of the existing pages. Making them consistent, modern, and uncomplicated. After testing these pages with some of the users, I realized that the site was still too spread out and needed to be condensed.</p>

    <h6 id="High">Low-Res and Color</h6>
    <p>This project had a short time frame, so I created some more simple sketches of my new idea and after quickly testing them, I started looking into some of the design decisions I would be able to create with basic coding. I looked into color psychology as well as some other non-profit websites for comparison. I chose something a clean, professional-looking design that conveyed support. Because of the nature of the non-profit organization, I was unable to use any images of their members or from their meetings and therefore had to find copyright-free images online that conveyed support and enhanced the information I was presenting.</p>

    <h5>Deliverables</h5>
    <p>Due to the short time frame and limited budget, I resorted to using multiple bootstrap elements. I was also limited to basic level coding, but feel the site still accomplished all the designs I planned. I condensed all of the site’s information into one page so that it was easy to view. I also grouped all the information and arranged it so that it was easy to leave and come back to. After testing the final product and producing my results, the stakeholders were happy and agreed to make the new site live without changes.</p>

    <h5>Final Thoughts</h5>
    <p>This project was so much fun, and I really enjoyed getting to work for such a great cause. I loved that I was able to practice some of the research methods that I don’t typically get to use. I am also happy to say that they loved the site so much that the state COAC president personally asked me to redesign their site as well. The state COAC site changes should be made by the end of November of this year.</p>
